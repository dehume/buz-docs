# S3

**ðŸŸ¢ Supported**

The `s3` cache backend uses schemas stored in s3 to back the in-memory cache.

## Sample S3 Cache Backend Configuration

```
schemaCache:
  backend:
    type: s3                  # The backend type
    bucket: honeypot-schemas  # The s3 bucket containing schemas
    path: /                   # The path to consider as root
```
