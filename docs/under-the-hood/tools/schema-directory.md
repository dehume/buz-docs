# Schema Directory

If the `schemaDirectory` is `enabled`, all "currently-cached" schemas are available at `/schemas`.

Individual schemas are also available at `/schemas/$NAME_OF_SCHEMA`.

:::tip For Example
If a schema was named `io.silverton/honeypot/tele/beat/v1.0.json`, the schema would be available at `$COLLECTOR_URL/schemas/io.silverton/honeypot/tele/beat/v1.0.json`.
